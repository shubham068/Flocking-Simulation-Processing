# Flocking Simulation (Starling Birds) using Processing
This is a simulation for Starling Birds. We will model and simulate this fascinating phenomenon.
We will computationally simulate the phenomenon by modelling each bird as an independent agent communicating and cooperating with other neighbouring agents. Our objective will be to measure from a realistic simulation the average energy spend by each bird, the angular momentum and the force that each bird has to withstand in a typical flight ritual.

# How to Use it??
Well , it is easy.
Just download the Processing software from the official site. Open the exe file that comes with it and open our .pde file. Now, run this file and you will be able to see our Simulation!
