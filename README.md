# Flocking Simulation (Starling Birds) using Processing
This is a simulation for Starling Birds. We will model and simulate this fascinating phenomenon.
We will computationally simulate the phenomenon by modelling each bird as an independent agent communicating and cooperating with other neighbouring agents. Our objective will be to measure from a realistic simulation the average energy spend by each bird, the angular momentum and the force that each bird has to withstand in a typical flight ritual.

## What is Flocking? 
It is the  collective behavior of huge swarms of birds (Starling Birds).Their flocking
maneuvers are of dazzling complexity in their changes in density and flock shape, but the
processes underlying them are still a mystery.Murmurations exhibit strong spatial coherence
and show extremely synchronized manoeuvres, which seem to occur spontaneously, or in
response to an approaching threat, like hawks or peregrine falcons.
## How to Use it?
Well , it is easy.
Just download the Processing software from the official site. Open the exe file that comes with it and open our .pde file. Now, run this file and you will be able to see our Simulation!

## Functionalities in our Simulation
There are many functionalities in our model.
The model contains various hyper-parameters like alignment,cohersion,sepration and obstacles.
Using different keys you can switch them on or off.

### Functionalities using Numeral Keys:-  
1 : This switches the alignment parameter.  
2 : This switches the crowd-avoidance parameter.  
3 : This switches the obstacle-avoidance parameter.  
4 : This switches the cohesion parameter.  
5 : This switches the noise parameter.  


### Zoom In/Zoom Out:-  
We can zoom in using 'M' key.    
We can zoom out using 'N' key.
